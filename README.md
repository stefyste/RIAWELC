# RIAWELC
This is a radiographic image dataset for weld defects classification.
The RIAWELC dataset collects 24,407 224x224 8-bit radigraphic images digitalized in the .png format
Four classes of weld defects are represented: lack of penetration (LP), porosity (PO), cracks (CR) and no defect (ND)

The dataset is released freely.
